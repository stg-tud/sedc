<h2>Open-Closed Principle</h2>
<section class="slide" data-title="Open-Closed Principle"><div class="section-body"><h1>Open-Closed Principle</h1>
<div class="statement">Software entities (classes, modules, functions, components, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modifications.</div>
<p><strong>Extension</strong>: Extending the behavior of a module.</p>
<p><strong>Modification</strong>: Changing the code of a module.</p>
</div></section>
<h3>Extension and Modification</h3>
<section class="slide" data-title="Extension and Modification"><div class="section-body"><div class="statement">Why is it important to be closed for modifications?</div>
</div></section>
<p><em>Open for extension</em> means that when requirements of the application change, we can extend the module with new behaviors that reflect those changes. We change what the module does.</p>
<p><em>Closed for modification</em> means that changes in behavior do not result in changes in the module&apos;s source or binary code.</p>
<p>Several reasons for closing modules against changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The module was delivered to customers and a change will not be accepted. If you need to change something later, hopefully you opened your module for extension!</li>
<li>The module is a third-party Library/Framework and only available as binary code. If you need to change something, hopefully the third-party opened the module for extension!</li>
<li><strong>Most importantly</strong>: not changing existing code means modular compilation, testing and debugging. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Abstraction is the Key</h3>
<section class="slide" data-title="Abstraction is the Key"><div class="section-body"><h1>Abstraction is the Key</h1>
<div class="statement">To enable extending an entity without modifying it, abstract over subparts of its behavior.</div>
<blockquote><p>Many programming languages allow to create abstractions that are fixed and yet represent an unbounded group of possible behaviors!</p>
</blockquote>
</div></section>
<p>Different kinds of abstraction mechanisms exist:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Object-oriented languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstractions are encoded in abstract base classes resp. interfaces.</li>
<li>unbounded group of possible behaviors is represented by all the possible derivative classes resp. implementations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Functional languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>abstractions are encoded in function types.</li>
<li>unbounded group of possible behaviors is represented by all the possible first-class functions of the declared type.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, we shortly discuss the two main ways of abstracting over variability in object-oriented programs.</p>
<section class="slide" data-title="Abstracting Over Variations"><div class="section-body"><h1>Abstracting Over Variations</h1>
<p><img src="Images/OCP-Container.png" alt="OCP Container" /></p>
</div></section>
<ul>
<li><code>Container</code> declares the layout functionality but does not implement it. The rest of <code>Container</code> is implemented against the abstraction.</li>
<li>Concrete subclasses fill in the details over which <code>Container</code>’s implementation abstract.</li>
</ul>
<section class="slide" data-title="Abstracting Over Variations"><div class="section-body"><h1>Abstracting Over Variations</h1>
<p><img src="Images/OCP-Container-LayoutManager.png" alt="OCP Container LayoutManager" /></p>
</div></section>
<ul>
<li><code>Container</code> delegates the layout functionality to an abstraction. The rest of its functionality is implemented against this abstraction.</li>
<li>To change the behavior of an instance of <code>Container</code> we configure it with the <code>LayoutManager</code> of our choice.</li>
<li>We can add completely new behavior by implementing our own <code>LayoutManager</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Understanding the Open-Closed Principle</h3>
<section class="slide" data-title="Drawable Shapes - Initial Design"><div class="section-body"><h1>A Possible Design for Drawable Shapes</h1>
<p><img src="Images/OCP-ShapeInitialDesign.png" alt="OCP Shape" /></p>
<footer><div class="footer-body"><p>Drawing is implemented in separate methods (e.g., of class <code>Application</code>).</p>
</div></footer>
</div></section>
<ul>
<li>Each <code>Shape</code> identifies itself via the enumeration <code>ShapeType</code>.</li>
<li>Realizations of <code>Shape</code> declare specialized methods for the shape type they represent.</li>
</ul>
<section class="slide"><div class="section-body"><p><strong>Consider an application that draws shapes - circles and rectangles – on a standard GUI.</strong></p>
<p><img src="Images/OCP-SketchVectorDrawingApp.png" alt="OCP SketchVectorDrawingApp" /></p>
</div></section>
<section class="slide"><div class="section-body"><p><strong>Implementation of the drawing functionality:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="java">class Application {
  public void drawAllShapes(List&lt;Shape&gt; shapes) {
    for(Shape shape : shapes) {
      switch(shape.getType()) {
      case Circle:
        drawCircle((Circle)shape);
        break;
      case Rectangle:
        drawRectangle((Rectangle)shape);
        break;
  } } }

  private void drawCircle(Circle circle) { ... }

  private void drawRectangle(Rectangle rectangle) { ... }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Does this design conform to the open-closed design principle?</p>
</div></section>
<p><strong>Evaluating the proposed design:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adding new shapes is hard, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement a new realization of <code>Shape</code>.</li>
<li>Add a new member to <code>ShapeType</code>.<br />
This possibly leads to a recompile of all other realizations of <code>Shape</code>.</li>
<li><code>drawAllShapes</code> (and every method that uses shapes of different types) must be changed.<br />
We have to hunt for every place that contains conditional logic that distinguishes between types of shapes and we have to add code to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>drawAllShapes</code> is hard to reuse!<br />
When we reuse it, we have to bring along <code>Rectangle</code> and <code>Circle</code>.</li>
</ul>
<section class="slide" data-title="Rigid, Fragile, Immobile Designs"><div class="section-body"><h1>Rigid, Fragile and Immobile Designs</h1>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Rigid designs</strong> are hard to change – every change causes many changes to other parts of the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Fragile designs</strong> tend to break in many places when a single change is made. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Immobile designs</strong> contain parts that could be useful in other systems, but the effort and risk involved with separating those parts from the original system are too big.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When we evaluate our design, does it show signs of rigidity, fragility or immobility?</p>
</div></section>
<section class="slide"><div class="section-body"><h1>Evaluating the Design</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>Our design is rigid, fragile and immobile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The proposed design <strong>violates the open-closed design principle</strong> with respect to extensions with new kinds of shapes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We need to close our module against this kind of change by building appropriate abstractions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></section>
<p>Assessing our design w.r.t. its rigidity, fragility and immobility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our example design <strong>is rigid</strong>: Adding a new shape causes many existing classes to be changed.</li>
<li>Our example design <strong>is fragile</strong>: Many switch/case (if/else) statements that are both hard to find and hard to decipher.</li>
<li>Our example design <strong>is immobile</strong>: <code>drawAllShapes</code> is hard to reuse.</li>
</ul>
<section class="slide" data-title="Drawable Shapes - Refined Design"><div class="section-body"><h1>Refined Design for Drawable Shapes</h1>
<p><img src="Images/OCP-ShapeOCPConformDesign.png" alt="OCP ShapeOCPConformDesign" /></p>
</div></section>
<ul>
<li><p>Makes adding new shapes possible without modification.<br />
We just need to implement a new realization of <code>Shape</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>drawAllShapes</code> only depends on <code>Shape</code>.<br />
We can reuse it unchanged.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<section class="slide"><div class="section-body"><h1>Evaluating the Extensibility</h1>
<div class="statement">This solution complies to the open-closed design principle.</div>
<footer><div class="footer-body"><p>Is this unconditional statement correct?</p>
</div></footer>
</div></section>
<p>This unconditional statement is – of course – not correct. It is not possible to be open for all kinds of extension and also be closed for modification.</p>
<section class="slide"><div class="section-body"><h1>Other Kinds of Changes</h1>
<p><img src="Images/OCP-ShapeOCPConformDesign.png" alt="OCP ShapeOCPConformDesign" /></p>
<p>These abstractions are more of an hindrance to several other kinds of changes.</p>
</div></section>
<ul>
<li><p>Consider extending the design with further shape functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>shape transformations, shape dragging, …</li>
<li>calculating the intersection or union of shapes, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider adding support for different operating systems.<br />
The implementation of the drawing functionality varies for different operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<section class="slide"><div class="section-body"><div class="statement">Abstractions May <strong>Support</strong> or <strong>Hinder</strong> Change!</div>
</div></section>
<ul>
<li>Change is easy if change units correspond to abstraction units.<br />
In our example, adding a new type of <code>Shape</code> is easy as it is directly supported by inheritance and subtyping.</li>
<li>Change is tedious if change units do not correspond to abstraction units.</li>
</ul>
<aside><div class="aside-body"><p>Consider again the Scala-based implementation of our SmartHome scenario. In the given design it is easily possible to add support for a new type of <code>Location</code>, but adding new functionality – while still being possible – is harder as seen in the previous example.</p>
<p>For example, adding support for a new type of <code>Room</code> is straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="scala">trait Estate extends Building {
   trait Garage extends TLocation
}

trait EstateWithLightsAndShutters extends Estate with LightsAndShutters {
   trait Garage extends super.Garage with super[LightsAndShutters].TLocation
}

object EstatesWithLightsAndShutters extends EstateWithLightsAndShutters {

   type Location = TLocation
   type Room = TRoom
   type Floor = TFloor
   type House = THouse

   def createRoom(): Room = new Room { 
         var lights: List[Light] = Nil
         var shutters: List[Shutter] = Nil }
   def createFloor(rooms: List[Room]): Floor = new Floor { val locations = rooms }
   def createHouse(floors: List[Floor]): House = new House { val locations = floors }

   class Garage(
      val lights: List[Light] = Nil, 
      val shutters: List[Shutter] = Nil) extends super.Garage

   val garage = new Garage(Nil, Nil)
   garage.turnLightsOff
   garage.turnLightsOn
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Abstractions Reflect a Viewpoint</h3>

<p>Three stakeholders:</p>
<ul>
<li>Veterinary surgeon: <strong>What matters is how animals reproduce!</strong></li>

They are to land at one end of the arena and then <strong>walk</strong> towards a small door on the side. At the same time, a killer whale should <strong>swim</strong> in circles and <strong>jump</strong> just as the pelicans fly by. After the jump, the sea lion should <strong>swim</strong> past the whale, <strong>jump</strong> out of the pool, and <strong>walk</strong> towards the center stage where the announcer is waiting for him.”</p>
